Got it, here's the updated version with the `#` symbol before each title:

# This project contains two main parts: an interactive coding challenges section and a photo gallery.

# Interactive Coding Challenges
The interactive coding challenges section allows users to solve coding problems related to array manipulation and string transformation. Users can input their data, and the solutions will be displayed on the screen.

# Explanation
This section provides an interactive platform for users to practice their coding skills by solving challenges related to array manipulation and string transformation. Users can input their data into the provided input fields, and upon submission, the solutions to the challenges will be displayed on the screen. This feature allows users to test their solutions against the provided implementations and learn from their mistakes.

# Photo Gallery
The photo gallery displays a set of cards with images and information about different animals. Users can hover over each card to reveal a "Read More" text, and the image will be blurred and grayscaled. The gallery is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

# Explanation
The photo gallery section presents a collection of cards, each displaying an image and information about a specific animal. When the user hovers over a card, a "Read More" text appears, and the image undergoes a blur and grayscale effect, adding an interactive element to the gallery. Additionally, the gallery is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

# Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Open the index.html file in the challenges folder to access the interactive coding challenges.
4. Open the index.html file in the taskforce-take-ho... folder to access the photo gallery.

# Approach and Implementation Details

# Interactive Coding Challenges
The interactive coding challenges section is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **HTML Structure**: The index.html file in the challenges folder contains the structure and user interface elements, such as input fields and buttons.
2. **CSS Styling**: The app.css file in the css folder provides the styling for the challenges section.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: The main functionality is implemented in the app.js file in the js folder. The JavaScript code includes the following:
   - **Tab Switching**: The openChallenge function handles the switching between different challenge tabs.
   - **Array Manipulation**: The subarraySum function implements the solution for the array manipulation challenge, checking if there exists a subarray in the given array with a sum equal to the target sum.
   - **String Transformation**: The transformString function implements the solution for the string transformation challenge, reversing the given string.
   - **User Input Handling**: The checkSubarraySum and transformUserString functions handle user input from the input fields and display the results.

# Photo Gallery
The photo gallery is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **HTML Structure**: The index.html file in the taskforce-take-ho... folder contains the structure for the gallery container.
2. **CSS Styling**: The app.css file in the css folder provides the styling for the gallery, including the card layout, hover effects, and responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: The main functionality is implemented in the app.js file in the js folder. The JavaScript code includes the following:
   - **Card Data**: An array of card data objects containing the image path, title, and location information.
   - **Card Creation**: The createCard function dynamically creates card elements based on the card data objects.
   - **Gallery Population**: The code loops through the card data and creates card elements, appending them to the gallery container.
   - **Hover Effects**: Event listeners are added to each card, showing and hiding the "Read More" text on hover.

# Dependencies
The project uses the following external dependencies:

1. **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family
2. **External Font**: D-DIN Condensed font family

These fonts are imported using the @import rule in the app.css file.
